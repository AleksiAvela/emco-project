# emco-project

This repository includes a Python implementation of the Extrapolated Markov Chain Oversampling (EMCO) method introduced in the submitted manuscript *Extrapolated Markov Chain Oversampling (EMCO) Method for Imbalanced Text Classification* and the source code for the presented experiments on the Reuters-21578 (Distribution 1.0) data set.

The file example.py can be used for testing the methods on a single classification task, while the file tests.py runs tests on the entire data set and averages the results as presented in the manuscript.

For the source codes and documentations of the other tested methods, please refer to: https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/index.html and https://github.com/AlexMoreo/pydro, and for more information about the Reuters-21578 corpus, see: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/reuters-21578+text+categorization+collection
